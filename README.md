# redditbotsamples
This is a collection of sample Reddit bots to do various specific things.  I do not expect you to run multiple of these at the same time, they're more for "this is one way to accomplish this."  If you want to merge multiple scripts into one, or have them run forever, that's up to you.

This assumes you have Python 3 and the latest version of PRAW.  These scripts may or may not work when they're uploaded, or when you pull them down.  Look at these as examples rather than working functional code ( though some might work ).
